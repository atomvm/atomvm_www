## 2024/05/06 Announcing AtomVM v0.6.1

We are pleased to announce the release of v0.6.1 of the AtomVM virtual machine!

This is a small update that introduces a new experimental feature: an optimized GC mode. This mode uses C's realloc instead of copying data around and can be enabled with the `-DENABLE_REALLOC_GC=On` flag.

The other notable changes include several bug fixes:

- A crash on macOS has been addressed by adding a missing call to psa_crypto_init for TLS 1.3.
- Functions such as fun m:f/a are now correctly displayed and converted to lists.
- An issue where the unique integer was truncated on some 32-bit architectures has been fixed, particularly when using `erlang:ref_to_list/1` and `erlang:display/1`.

For the full set of bug fixes, changes and additions consult the [Changelog](https://www.atomvm.net/doc/v0.6.1/CHANGELOG.html), and check the [Updating Instructions](https://github.com/atomvm/AtomVM/blob/v0.6.1/UPDATING.md).

Download images and binaries are available for most platforms, except STM32, are available from [AtomVM Releases on GitHub](https://github.com/atomvm/AtomVM/releases/tag/v0.6.1). STM32 users as well as anyone needing to build a generic_unix port for a device without release binaries should consult the [Build Instructions](https://www.atomvm.net/doc/v0.6.1/build-instructions.html).

The git repository and tarballs of the AtomVM source release for all platforms can be found on our [GitHub AtomVM page](https://github.com/atomvm/AtomVM).

Documentation for the v0.6.1 pre-release of the AtomVM virtual machine, including a Getting Started Guide, can be found at the [AtomVM Documentation page](https://www.atomvm.net/doc/v0.6.1/).

As always, tools, drivers, and modules are available on the [GitHub AtomVM Project page](https://github.com/atomvm).

Many thanks go to [Davide Bettio](https://github.com/bettio), for creating such a fine work of software, as well as the [contributors](https://github.com/atomvm/AtomVM/graphs/contributors) and [testers who have helped make this release possible](https://github.com/atomvm/AtomVM/issues).
