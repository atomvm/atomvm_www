## 2024/05/29 Announcing AtomVM v0.6.2

We are pleased to announce the release of v0.6.2 of the AtomVM virtual machine!

This release changes the ssl default from `{active, false}` to `{active, true}` in order to have same behavior as OTP, as well as fixing several ssl related bugs.  Stacktraces are now enabled by default on the rp2040 platform; so, like the ESP32, when a user application crashes a stacktrace will be emitted to make debugging applications easier.  

We have added support for the ESP32-C2, as well as DragonFly BSD on the generic_unix platform. Other additions include `esp:deep_sleep_enable_gpio_wakeup/2` to allow wakeup from deep sleep for ESP32C3 and ESP32C6, as well as the ability for WiFi enabled devices to obtain the signal strength of the connection to an access point using `network:sta_rssi/0`.  A number of new functions have been added to the proplists module, and guards `is_even` and `is_odd` have been added to the Elixir Integer module.

For the full set of bug fixes, changes and additions consult the [Changelog](https://doc.atomvm.org/v0.6.2/CHANGELOG.html), and check the [Updating Instructions](https://github.com/atomvm/AtomVM/blob/v0.6.2/UPDATING.md).

Download images and binaries are available for most platforms, except STM32, are available from [AtomVM Releases on GitHub](https://github.com/atomvm/AtomVM/releases/tag/v0.6.2). STM32 users as well as anyone needing to build a generic_unix port for a device without release binaries should consult the [Build Instructions](https://doc.atomvm.org/v0.6.2/build-instructions.html).

The git repository and tarballs of the AtomVM source release for all platforms can be found on our [GitHub AtomVM page](https://github.com/atomvm/AtomVM).

Documentation for the v0.6.2 pre-release of the AtomVM virtual machine, including a Getting Started Guide, can be found at the [AtomVM Documentation page](https://doc.atomvm.org/v0.6.2/).

As always, tools, drivers, and modules are available on the [GitHub AtomVM Project page](https://github.com/atomvm).

Many thanks go to [Davide Bettio](https://github.com/bettio), for creating such a fine work of software, as well as the [contributors](https://github.com/atomvm/AtomVM/graphs/contributors) and [testers who have helped make this release possible](https://github.com/atomvm/AtomVM/issues).
