## 2024/10/15 AtomVM v0.6.5 MacOS update options

Updates for MacOS through `macports` and `homebrew` are now available for AtomVM v0.6.5. For first time installation see the [MacOS installation section](https://doc.atomvm.org/v0.6.5/getting-started-guide.html#installation-on-macos) of the [Getting Started Guide](https://doc.atomvm.org/v0.6.5/getting-started-guide.html).

To upgrade a previously tapped `homebrew`  install use:

    $ brew update
    $ brew upgrade atomvm

To upgrade an install from `macports` 

    $ sudo port selfupdate
    $ sudo port upgrade outdated

For all the details about the AtomVM v0.6.5 release see the [release announcement](https://www.atomvm.net/2024/10/14/Release_v0.6.5.html).

Documentation for the v0.6.5 release of the AtomVM virtual machine, including a
[Getting Started Guide](https://doc.atomvm.org/v0.6.5/getting-started-guide.html), can be found in the
[AtomVM Documentation](https://doc.atomvm.org/v0.6.5/).

To help get you inspired there are examples ready to use with our [`ExAtomVM mix`](https://github.com/atomvm/ExAtomVM) and [`atomvm_rebar3_plugin`](https://github.com/atomvm/atomvm_rebar3_plugin) standard tool plugins in the [AtomVM examples repository](https://github.com/atomvm/atomvm_examples) on GitHub.

Many thanks go to [Davide Bettio](https://github.com/bettio), for creating and maintaining such a
fine work of software, to [Paul Guyot](https://github.com/pguyot) for maintaining the `macports` release, and to [Peter Madsen-Mygdal](https://github.com/petermm) for maintaining the `homebrew tap`, along with all of their other contributions ;-)
