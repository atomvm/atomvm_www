      <h2 id="20241014-announcing-atomvm-v065">2024/10/14 Announcing AtomVM v0.6.5</h2>

<p>We are pleased to announce the release of v0.6.5 of the AtomVM virtual machine!</p>

<p>First and foremost our apologies to ESP32 users wanting to use all the great new Elixir features added in the V0.6.4 release. The binary images were corrupted and may Elixir features were unavailable. We have fixed the problem and now publish an Elixir flavored image that has a larger library partition. This change necessitates changing the application partition offset to 0x250000. The <a href="https://github.com/atomvm/exatomvm">ExAtomVM <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mix</code></a> plugin repository has already been updated with the correct default offset, a new release should be available in the very near future.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: We are investigating <a href="https://github.com/atomvm/AtomVM/issues/1324">a bug</a> in the ESP32 <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">i2c</code> driver, that was reported hours before this release, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">i2c:write_bytes</code> on ESP32 seems to be causing a hard fault, as a workaround use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">i2c:write_byte</code> instead.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Expanded Erlang support includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">erlang:atom_to_binary/1</code> that is equivalent to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">erlang:atom_to_binary(Atom, utf8)</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">is_bitstring/1</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">maps:merge_with/3</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lists:keytake/3</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lists:last/1</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lists:mapfoldl/3</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lists:nthtail/2</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">support for handle_continue callback in gen_server</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gen_server:start_monitor/3,4</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">code:ensure_loaded/1</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">io_lib:latin1_char_list/1</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">io:put_chars/2</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">erlang:list_to_integer/2</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">binary_to_integer/2</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">binary:copy/1,2</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">binary:split/3</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">binary:decode_hex/1</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">binary:encode_hex/1,2</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">string:find/2,3</code></li>
  <li>Support for directory listing using POSIX APIs: (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">atomvm:posix_opendir/1</code>,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">atomvm:posix_readdir/1</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">atomvm:posix_closedir/1</code>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Expanded Elixir support features:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">String.Chars</code> protocol, now functions such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Enum.join</code> are able to take
also non string parameters; e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Enum.join([1, 2], ",")</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Enumerable</code> protocol</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Process.send/2</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Process.send_after/3/4</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Process.cancel_timer/1</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">List.Chars</code> protocol</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">List.duplicate/2</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Keyword.split/2</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">IO.chardata_to_string/1</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Base.decode16/2</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Base.encode16/2</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Enum.find_index</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Enum.find_value</code> support Enumerable and not just lists</li>
</ul>

<p>Enhancements to the ESP32 platform:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The ESP32 platform now includes the <a href="https://www.atomvm.net/doc/v0.6.5/apidocs/erlang/eavmlib/esp_adc.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">esp_adc</code></a> driver module for using the ADC peripheral to measure analog voltages. Building from source, and including the atomvm_adc component is no longer necessary (or even supported, now that ESP-IDF v4.4.x has been deprecated).</li>
  <li>Support for mounting/unmounting storage on ESP32 (such as SD or internal flash) using
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">esp:mount/4</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">esp:umount/1</code></li>
  <li>Made the device_config properties list in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">spi:open/1</code> optional (defaults to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[]</code>), so you can use the function with only a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bus_config</code></li>
  <li>The network driver supports a callback for beacon lost events (usually encountered when signal quality is poor or network congestion), <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">network:stop/0</code> works as expected.</li>
</ul>

<p>Many bugs have been fixed in addition to the previously mentioned fix for ESP32 images, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed memory corruption in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">unicode:characters_to_binary</code></li>
  <li>Fixed handling of large literal indexes and large extended literal indexes</li>
  <li>Fixed bogus out_of_memory error when using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">unicode:characters_to_list</code> on some platforms such as ESP32</li>
  <li>Fix crash in Elixir library when doing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inspect(:atom)</code></li>
  <li>General <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inspect()</code> compliance with Elixir behavior (but there are still some minor differences)</li>
  <li>On ESP32 <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">uart:open/1,2</code> now works with uppercase peripheral names</li>
  <li>Several edge case memory bugs were fixed in the ESP32 network driver, ans when stopped all resources are freed.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug in decoding terms that led to some pin numbers being rejected when setting GPIO interrupts on the ESP32 platform.</li>
</ul>

<p>For the full set of bug fixes, changes and additions consult the
<a href="https://www.atomvm.net/doc/v0.6.5/CHANGELOG.html">Changelog</a>.</p>

<p>We are pleased to announce the release of v0.6.4 of the AtomVM virtual machine!</p>

<p>This release greatly enhances support for Elixir language programming. Many Elixir modules and functions have been added:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Implement missing opcode 161 (raw_raise), that looks more likely to be generated with Elixir code</li>
  <li>Support for Elixir Kernel:
    <ul>
      <li>Kernel.struct and Kernel.struct!</li>
      <li>Kernel.min and Kernel.max</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>MapSet module</li>
  <li>Range module</li>
  <li>Enum functions: split_with, join, map_join, into, reverse, slice and to_list</li>
  <li>Map.replace/3 and Map.replace!/3</li>
  <li>IO.iodata_to_binary/1</li>
  <li>Support for Elixir Enumerable and Collectable protocol</li>
  <li>Support for Elixir exceptions: Exception module and the other error related modules such as ArgumentError, UndefinedFunctionError, etc…</li>
  <li>Support (as stub) for erlang:error/3 (that is required from Elixir code)</li>
</ul>

<p>The ESP32 platform now implements <a href="https://www.atomvm.net/doc/v0.6.4/apidocs/erlang/eavmlib/gpio.html#init-1"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gpio:init/1</code></a>, which was previously only used (and required) on the rp2040 platform. This function is used to initialize pins for GPIO usage, which some pins require depending on default function and bootloader code.</p>

<p>We are pleased to announce the release of v0.6.3 of the AtomVM virtual machine!</p>

<p>This release expands OTP coverage to include the Erlang <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sets</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">queue</code> modules and several
Elixir <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Keyword</code> functions: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Keyword.merge</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Keyword.take</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Keyword.pop(!)</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Keyword.keyword?</code>,
and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Keyword.has_key?</code>. Support for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~kp</code> with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">io_lib:format/2</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">maps:iterator/2</code> that were
introduced with OTP26 have added, along with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">maps:from_keys/2</code>. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lists</code> modules gains support
for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lists:keytake/3</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lists:keystore/4</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lists:filtermap/2</code>. Support for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">erlang:size/1</code> and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">erlang:apply/2</code> has also been added.</p>

<p>A simple <a href="https://www.atomvm.net/doc/v0.6.3/apidocs/erlang/eavmlib/ahttp_client.html">http client</a>,
that can be used for different use cases, such as downloading OTA updates has been added to
<a href="https://www.atomvm.net/doc/v0.6.3/apidocs/erlang/eavmlib/README.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">eavmlib</code></a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.atomvm.net/doc/v0.6.3/network-programming-guide.html#ap-mode">channel used in access point mode</a>
can now be changed in the
<a href="https://www.atomvm.net/doc/v0.6.3/apidocs/erlang/eavmlib/network.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">network</code></a> driver.</p>

<p>This release adds support for <a href="https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32-h2">ESP32-H2</a>
devices. Support has also been added for USB serial output on ESP32 devices with native USB support
(ESP32-S2 for example).</p>

<p>Notable changes include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the default size of ESP32 RTC slow memory being bumped from 4086 to 4096, except on ESP32-H2
where it’s 3072 bytes</li>
  <li>updates to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">byte_size/1</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bit_size/1</code> to implement OTP27 match context reuse optimization
OTP-18987</li>
  <li>ESP32 network driver messages for event 40 (home channel change events) are now suppressed,
but the details for the channel changes can be observed in the console log if “debug” level
logging is enabled in ESP-IDF Kconfig options.</li>
</ul>

<p>Several bugs have been fixed, including the creation of multiple links for the same process and
links not being removed at trapped exits. A bug affecting binary pattern matching (for builds with
OTP-21) has been fixed, and several memory related bugs have been corrected, as well as a bug that
could yield crashes when functions are sent in messages. The error that is raised when a function
is undefined has also been fixed.</p>

<p>This release changes the ssl default from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{active, false}</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{active, true}</code> in order to have same behavior as OTP, as well as fixing several ssl related bugs.  Stacktraces are now enabled by default on the rp2040 platform; so, like the ESP32, when a user application crashes a stacktrace will be emitted to make debugging applications easier.</p>

<p>We have added support for the ESP32-C2, as well as DragonFly BSD on the generic_unix platform. Other additions include <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">esp:deep_sleep_enable_gpio_wakeup/2</code> to allow wakeup from deep sleep for ESP32C3 and ESP32C6, as well as the ability for WiFi enabled devices to obtain the signal strength of the connection to an access point using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">network:sta_rssi/0</code>.  A number of new functions have been added to the proplists module, and guards <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">is_even</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">is_odd</code> have been added to the Elixir Integer module.</p>

<p>For the full set of bug fixes, changes and additions consult the <a href="https://www.atomvm.net/doc/v0.6.2/CHANGELOG.html">Changelog</a>, and check the <a href="https://github.com/atomvm/AtomVM/blob/v0.6.2/UPDATING.md">Updating Instructions</a>.</p>

<p>Download images and binaries are available for most platforms, except STM32, are available from <a href="https://github.com/atomvm/AtomVM/releases/tag/v0.6.2">AtomVM Releases on GitHub</a>. STM32 users as well as anyone needing to build a generic_unix port for a device without release binaries should consult the <a href="https://www.atomvm.net/doc/v0.6.2/build-instructions.html">Build Instructions</a>.</p>

<p>We are pleased to announce the release of v0.6.1 of the AtomVM virtual machine!</p>

<p>This is a small update that introduces a new experimental feature: an optimized GC mode. This mode uses C’s realloc instead of copying data around and can be enabled with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-DENABLE_REALLOC_GC=On</code> flag.</p>

<p>The other notable changes include several bug fixes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A crash on macOS has been addressed by adding a missing call to psa_crypto_init for TLS 1.3.</li>
  <li>Functions such as fun m:f/a are now correctly displayed and converted to lists.</li>
  <li>An issue where the unique integer was truncated on some 32-bit architectures has been fixed, particularly when using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">erlang:ref_to_list/1</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">erlang:display/1</code>.</li>

      <h2 id="20240323-announcing-atomvm-v060">2024/03/23 Announcing AtomVM v0.6.0</h2>

<p>We missed announcing the last few beta and rc releases that all came in a flurry as we were busy doing tests on hardware and this announcement is actually late, but for anyone who missed it, we are pleased to announce that we have a new v0.6.0 stable release!</p>

<p>In this release <a href="https://www.atomvm.net/doc/v0.6.0/apidocs/erlang/eavmlib/spi.html">SPI</a>, <a href="https://www.atomvm.net/doc/v0.6.0/apidocs/erlang/eavmlib/i2c.html">I2C</a>, and <a href="https://www.atomvm.net/doc/v0.6.0/apidocs/erlang/eavmlib/uart.html">UART</a> peripheral configurations have been changed, for details consult the documentation for these modules in the <a href="https://www.atomvm.net/doc/v0.6.0/apidocs/erlang/eavmlib/README.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">eavmlib</code> documentation</a>. There is now an ESP32 API for allowing coexistence of native and Erlang I2C drivers, for example, allowing the use of the native <a href="https://github.com/atomvm/atomvm_ssd1306"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">atomvm_ssd1306</code> Display driver</a>, with a pure erlang driver for the <a href="https://github.com/atomvm/atomvm_examples/tree/master/erlang/i2c_example">SHT3x temperature sensor</a>. GPIO interrupt (currently only supported on ESP32 and STM32 platforms) messages can now be sent to a designated receiver using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gpio:set_int/4</code>. Support for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lists:split/2</code> has also been added. ESP32 platform now supports retrieving the device’s e-fuse MAC address with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">esp:get_default_mac/0</code>.</p>

<p>AtomVM now uses UTF-8 encoding for atoms when using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">erlang:term_to_binary/1</code>, in conformance with OTP-26, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">binary_to_atom/1</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">atom_to_binary/1</code> now default to utf8.  Support has been added for utf8 encoding to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*_to_atom</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">atom_to_*</code> functions.</p>

<p>We have made improvements to the rp2040 platform that should make development workflows much smoother.  The device will now accept re-flashing a new application using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">atomvm_rebar3_plugin</code> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pico_flash</code> task after the application has exited.  Previously the device would be unresponsive after exiting.  There is also a default 20 second timeout, which the device will wait for a USB console connection to be established, before running the application.  Previously our default build would start the application immediately, giving the user no time to connect to be able to see the output of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hello_world</code> before the application exited, and the device became unresponsive.</p>

<p>The port call tuple format has been changed to the same format as gen_server, so cast support can be added. This change means older versions of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">atomvmlib</code> will not work, libraries from latest version must be used. Check the <a href="https://github.com/atomvm/AtomVM/blob/v0.6.0/UPDATING.md">Update Instructions</a> for other breaking changes for both BEAM application developers, as well as for contributors, and driver developers using nifs or ports.</p>

<p>Under the hood enhancements feature a new atom table, which uses less memory, and has improved performance.</p>

<p>Several memory related bugs have been fixed. A random number generation bug has been fixed on ESP32 and RPi2040, as well as a bug shared by both platforms that would cause invalid GPIO pull directions to be silently set to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">floating</code> without an error.</p>

<p>For the full set of bug fixes, changes and additions consult the <a href="https://www.atomvm.net/doc/v0.6.0/CHANGELOG.html">Changelog</a>, and check the <a href="https://github.com/atomvm/AtomVM/blob/v0.6.0/UPDATING.md">Updating Instructions</a>.</p>

<p>Download images and binaries are available for most platforms, except STM32 (and some generic_unix hosts for this release due to specific Mbed-TLS requirements) are available from <a href="https://github.com/atomvm/AtomVM/releases/tag/v0.6.0">AtomVM Releases on GitHub</a>.

<p>We are pleased to announce that our pre-release of v0.6.0 is now in beta!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Wait! What happened to the v0.6.0-beta.0 release?
Our all volunteer QA team (thank you @petermm) discovered a problem with the ESP32S3 builds that caused starting <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">esp32init.beam</code> to crash the VM. This is the default network application that will create a wireless AP on an ESP32 that has been flashed with the AtomVM image, but does not have a user application flashed yet. Once connected to the “AtomVM-ESP32” network that is created you can access an alisp console at 192.168.4.1 on port 2323, or connect to http port 8080 to change the network to station mode and connect to a wifi network, where the arepl console will be available on port 2323 on the devices acquired IP address. We have determined the cause of the problem, but it has not been fixed in this release.</p>

<p>Earlier this month the name of the <a href="https://github.com/atomvm/AtomVM">AtomVM</a> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">master</code> branch was renamed to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main</code>.  If you have previously made a local clone of the repository, and would like to keep up to date with changes to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main</code> branch, there are a few <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git</code> commands that will rename your local copy and update the git configuration to track the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main</code> AtomVM branch on GitHub.</p>

<p>From inside your local clone of <a href="https://github.com/atomvm/AtomVM">AtomVM</a>:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>shell$ git branch -m master main
shell$ git fetch origin
shell$ git branch -u origin/main main
shell$ git remote set-head origin -a

<p>At this point you now have a local clone that will stay up to date with changes in the upstream AtomVM <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main</code> branch.</p>

<p>We have also recently created the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">release-0.6</code> branch, which should be used if you wish to contribute any bug fixes.  If you do find a bug, please open an <a href="https://github.com/atomvm/AtomVM/issues">issue on GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>If you encounter a feature you think we are lacking, please <a href="https://github.com/atomvm/AtomVM/issues">open an issue</a> for that too.  Any contributions of new features should be made on the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main</code> branch.</p>

<h2 id="20220405-atomvm-example-programs">2022/04/05 AtomVM Example Programs</h2>

<p>We have extracted our example programs into a self-contained and growing github repo with minimal dependencies. For example, if you have flashed the AtomVM image to an ESP32 device, you can simply use rebar3 to build and flash your applications, making the compile/flash/debug cycle you experience on embedded devices fairly painless.</p>

<p>Please note that at this stage, support for building Elixir programs is quite far behind that of Erlang, so best to stick with Erlang until further notice.</p>
