<meta name="description" content="2024/05/06 Announcing AtomVM v0.6.1 We are pleased to announce the release of v0.6.1 of the AtomVM virtual machine! This is a small update that introduces a new experimental feature: an optimized GC mode. This mode uses C’s realloc instead of copying data around and can be enabled with the -DENABLE_REALLOC_GC=On flag. The other notable changes include several bug fixes: A crash on macOS has been addressed by adding a missing call to psa_crypto_init for TLS 1.3. Functions such as fun m:f/a are now correctly displayed and converted to lists. An issue where the unique integer was truncated on some 32-bit architectures has been fixed, particularly when using erlang:ref_to_list/1 and erlang:display/1. For the full set of bug fixes, changes and additions consult the Changelog, and check the Updating Instructions. Download images and binaries are available for most platforms, except STM32, are available from AtomVM Releases on GitHub. STM32 users as well as anyone needing to build a generic_unix port for a device without release binaries should consult the Build Instructions. The git repository and tarballs of the AtomVM source release for all platforms can be found on our GitHub AtomVM page. Documentation for the v0.6.1 pre-release of the AtomVM virtual machine, including a Getting Started Guide, can be found at the AtomVM Documentation page. As always, tools, drivers, and modules are available on the GitHub AtomVM Project page. Many thanks go to Davide Bettio, for creating such a fine work of software, as well as the contributors and testers who have helped make this release possible. The AtomVM team" />
